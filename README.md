Then run these commands:

git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate into the project directory

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server with live reload
npm run dev


# Install dependencies

   Click the pencil (edit) icon.
   Make your changes and commit directly.

2. Use GitHub Codespaces (Optional)

   From your repoâ€™s main page, click the green Code button.
   Select the Codespaces tab.
